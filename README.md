# ClearMeasureInterview

Notes from the interview:

The initial unit test project didn't work because I created an NUnit instead of MSUnit project.  My NUnit was still at 4.X creating an MSUnit test allowed 8.0 .NET compatability immediately

I capped the upper bound to 10000000 just because if there were too many more zeros I started running out of memory.
